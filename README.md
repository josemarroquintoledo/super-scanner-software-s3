Super Scanner Software (S3)
===========================

Super Scanner Software (S3) is an **open-source and completely free software environment to implement a low-cost microscopy**, which uses [Fourier Ptychography](https://sites.google.com/site/gazheng/Fourier-Ptychograph) algorithm, as a **3D scanner**. S3 is part of [**Super Scanner**](http://www.superscanner.cl) project.

Software Requirements
---------------------

> **Note:** currently, we are in the development phase and building the environment in machines that run the 64-bit version of **[Linux Mint 18 'Sarah'](https://linuxmint.com/download.php)** with MATE. As this GNU/Linux distribution **is based on another**, it is very probable that these packages work in your installation update to its latest version.

S3 is a set of Python modules to be executed in notebook [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) and [Blender](https://www.blender.org). For now, it is sufficient that you install:

- [**Anaconda3 (Python 3.5) 4.1.1**](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).

- [**Blender 2.77a**](https://www.blender.org/download/). It does not require to be installed: download it, untar and execute it.

Folders' Description
--------------------
Within the main folder, **super-scanner-software-s3**:

- **blend-scripts**: it contains Python **scripts to be imported and executed directly in Blender**. Those files **simulate the scanner's structure and some tasks** such as the taking low resolution photographs with a different LED of the grid for the subsequent call of the Fourier Ptychography.

- **jupyter-modules**: it has **Python modules written as Jupyter notebooks**. With those, it is possible to reconstruct the Hi-Res image from the sample from a Lo-Res image set.

- **img**: it has some images files to be used by [fwdimaging.ipynb](jupyter-modules/fwdimaging.ipynb)

Importing and Executing the Code
--------------------------------

### In Jupyter

In the main folder, there is a **sample notebook**: [tpl-s3.ipynb](tpl-s3.ipynb). In any notebook, a cell is executed from **Cells**&rarr;**Run Cell** or with <kbd>Shift</kbd> &#43; <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

> **Note**: ours notebook import others as modules. To get that feature in your Jupyter installation, follow the instructions in [98-jupyter-nb-import.ipynb](jupyter-modules/autostart/98-jupyter-nb-import.ipynb)

### In Blender

The files within **blend-scripts** can be imported in Blender from **Choose Screen layout**&rarr;**Scripting**&rarr;<kbd>Open</kbd>. To execute them, press <kbd>Run Script</kbd> button and wait for the result.
