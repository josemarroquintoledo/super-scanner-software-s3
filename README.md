SuperScanner Software (S3)
==========================

SuperScanner Software (S3) is an **free and open-source software environment used for implementing a low-cost scanner 3D**, which can also function as a **microscope and a 3D printer**. S3 is the software portion of [**SuperScanner**](http://en.superscanner.cl) project. SuperScanner Software (S3) is **licensed under [GPLv2](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html)** license.

S3 is compatible with [Microscopx](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2819042), a project that enhances a low-cost microscope with this software.

The Framework (ES)
------------------

Software Requirements
---------------------

> **Note:** These Jupyter modules has been tested in machinas that run the 64-bit version of [**KDE neon User Edition 5.12**](http://neon.kde.org/) based on [**Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS**](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/XenialXerus/ReleaseNotes?_ga=1.19022523.2089693014.1474004057).

S3 is written in Python 3. Some modules can be executed from notebooks [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org), as scripts in [Blender](https://www.blender.org) or both.

### Common

* [**Git**](https://git-scm.com). Install it from command-line with `$ sudo apt-get install git`. After installing, execute:

```
$ cd ~
$ git clone https://github.com/josemarroquintoledo/superscanner-software-s3.git
```

* [**Anaconda Distribution**](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux): Python +  &#171;250+ popular data science packages &#187;. Please, install the version for Python 3, because **S3 only works with Python 3**.

### Microscopy

[**OpenCV**](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/releases). We have tried with the 3.1.0 version and it works well (to 2018 March, 27th). After installing Anaconda Distribution, go to the command line and execute: `$ conda install opencv`.

### 3D Scanning (simulated)

We suggest the following order:

1. [**openMVG**](https://github.com/openMVG/openMVG) by [pmoulon](https://github.com/pmoulon) to &#171;recover camera poses and a sparse 3D point-cloud from an input set of images&#187;.

2. [**openMVS**](https://github.com/cdcseacave/openMVS) by [cdcseacave](https://github.com/cdcseacave) &#171;to recover the full surface of the scene to be reconstructed&#187; from the camera poses and the sparse 3D point-cloud obtained with openMVG.

3. [**Blender**](https://www.blender.org/download/). It can be installed from the command-line with `$ sudo apt-get install blender`.

4. [**Mesurelt**](https://github.com/Antonioya/blender/tree/master/measureit) (optional) by [Antonioya](https://github.com/Antonioya) is an add-on &laquo;for displaying measures \[of meshes\] in the vewport&raquo; in Blender. Download the ZIP file and install it in Blender from **File** &rarr; **User Preferences...** &rarr; **Add-ons** &rarr; <kbd>Install from File...</kbd>

5. [**py3exiv2**](http://www.py3exiv2.tuxfamily.org): Allows to use the lib exiv2 with Python 3. exiv2 is a C++ library designed to handle the EXIF image metadata.

6. [**IPython for Blender**](https://github.com/panzi/blender_ipython) by [panzi](https://github.com/panzi) to run Blender scripts in Jupyter notebooks. Before installing, make sure you installed the dependences. Anaconda Distribution does not resolve them: `$ sudo apt-get install python3-pip & sudo pip3 install --upgrade pip jupyter ipython notebook`.

7. [**MeshLab**](http://meshlab.sourceforge.net). Install with: `$ sudo apt-get install meshlab`.

Folders' Description
--------------------

Within the main folder, **superscanner-software-s3**:

- **[blend-meshes](blend-meshes/)**: it **contains printable parts and pieces** of SuperScanner Hardware (S2H), **the complete model** of the machine manipulable in Blender and **scenes that execute Blender scripts**.

- **[examples](examples/)**: it is a folder with **sample Jupyter notebooks**.

- **[img](img/)**: it has **pictures** that are used by some notebooks.

- **[jupyter-modules](jupyter-modules/)**: it contains **Python modules (libraries) written as Jupyter notebooks**. For example, this notebooks are used by the Fourier Ptychography algorithm and to access to the data and functions of Blender outside of it to simulate the picture taking process for photogrammetry, among others.

- **[scripts](scripts/)**: it contains **Python scripts** used to call the external software during the photogrammetry process, put the LEDs in the illuminator ring in the blend model of the machine (S2H), among others.

Importing and Executing the Code
--------------------------------

### In Blender

The files within **blend-scripts** can be imported in Blender from **Choose Screen layout**&rarr;**Scripting**&rarr;<kbd>Open</kbd>. To execute them, press <kbd>Run Script</kbd> button and wait for the result.
