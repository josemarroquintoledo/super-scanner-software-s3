SuperScanner Software (S3)
===========================

SuperScanner Software (S3) is an **free and open-source software environment used for implementing a low-cost scanner 3D**, which can also function as a **microscope and a 3D printer**. S3 is the software portion of [**SuperScanner**](http://en.superscanner.cl) project.

Functions
---------

### Microscope

To obtain high-quality and Hi-Res images, [**SuperScanner**](http://www.superscanner.cl) implements the [Fourier Ptychography](https://sites.google.com/site/gazheng/Fourier-Ptychograph) algorithm.

Software Requirements
---------------------

> **Note:** the correct functioning of these Jupyter modules has been tested in machines that run the 64-bit version of **[Linux Mint 18 'Sarah'](https://www.linuxmint.com/rel_sarah_cinnamon_whatsnew.php)** and **[budgie-remix](https://budgie-remix.org)** that are based on **[Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/XenialXerus/ReleaseNotes?_ga=1.19022523.2089693014.1474004057)**.

S3 is a set of Python modules to be executed in notebook [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) and [Blender](https://www.blender.org). For that, you have to **install the software packages in the list below**. We suggest the following order:

1. [**Git**](https://git-scm.com). Install it from command-line too with ``$ sudo apt-get install git``.

2. [**openMVG**](https://github.com/openMVG/openMVG) by [pmoulon](https://github.com/pmoulon) to &#171;recover camera poses and a sparse 3D point-cloud from an input set of images&#187; to reconstruct its 3D model. See its [building tex file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openMVG/openMVG/master/BUILD).

3. [**openMVS**](https://github.com/cdcseacave/openMVS) by [cdcseacave](https://github.com/cdcseacave) &#171;to recover the full surface of the scene to be reconstructed&#187; from the camera poses and the sparse 3D point-cloud obtained with openMVG. See the [building wiki page](https://github.com/cdcseacave/openMVS/wiki/Building) of this software project.

4. [**Anaconda3 (Python 3.5) 4.1.1**](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).

5. [**Numba**](http://numba.pydata.org) speed up the execution of the implementation of our Python code &laquo;generating optimized machine code using the LLVM compiler infrastructure at import time, runtime, or statically&raquo;. The installation of Numba is easy after installing [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). For that, from the command-line: `$ conda install numba`.

6. [**Blender 2.77a**](https://www.blender.org/download/). It does not require to be installed: download it, untar it and execute it. It also be installed from the command-line with ``$ sudo apt-get install blender``.

7. [**Mesurelt**](https://github.com/Antonioya/blender/tree/master/measureit) (optional) by [Antonioya](https://github.com/Antonioya) is an add-on &laquo;for displaying measures [of meshes] in the vewport&raquo; in Blender. Download the .ZIP file and install it in Blender from **File**&rarr;**User Preferences...**&rarr;**Add-ons**&rarr;<kbd>Install from File...</kbd>

8. [**py3exiv2**](http://www.py3exiv2.tuxfamily.org). It allows to use the lib exiv2 with Python 3. exiv2 is a C++ library designed to handle the EXIF image metadata.

9. [**IPython for Blender**](https://github.com/panzi/blender_ipython) by [panzi](https://github.com/panzi) to run Blender script in Jupyter notebooks. Before to follow the instructions from [there](https://github.com/panzi/blender_ipython), **make sure you installed the dependences**, because Anaconda3 does not resolve them: `$ sudo apt-get install python3-pip & sudo pip3 install --upgrade pip jupyter ipython notebook`.

10. [**MeshLab**](http://meshlab.sourceforge.net) to manipulate the 3D models (results). Install with: `$ sudo apt-get install meshlab`.

After the installation of the requirements, (step **11th**) **download SuperScanner Software** and **run Jupyter** by first time:

```
$ cd ~
$ git clone https://github.com/josemarroquintoledo/super-scanner-software-s3.git
$ cd super-scanner-software-s3
$ jupyter notebook
```

Folders' Description
--------------------

Within the main folder, **super-scanner-software-s3**:

- **[blend-meshes](blend-meshes/)**: it **contains printable parts and pieces** of SuperScanner Hardware (S2H), **the complete model** of the machine manipulable in Blender and **scenes that execute Blender scripts**.

- **[examples](examples/)**: it is a folder with **sample Jupyter notebooks**.

- **[jupyter-modules](jupyter-modules/)**: it contains **Python modules (libraries) written as Jupyter notebooks**. For example, this notebooks are used by the Fourier Ptychography algorithm and to access to the data and functions of Blender outside of it to simulate the picture taking process for photogrammetry, among others.

- **[img](img/)**: it has **pictures** that are used by some notebooks.

- **[stl](stl/)**: it contains the **meshes as STL files** used in the Blender files.

Importing and Executing the Code
--------------------------------

### In Jupyter

> **Note:** after the installation of [Anaconda3](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), navigate to [autostart](jupyter-modules/autostart) (jupyter-modules&rarr;autostart) and follow the instructions of the notebooks there.

Within of the [examples](examples/) folder, there are **sample notebooks** such as [fp-examples.ipynb](examples/fp-examples.ipynb)

In any notebook, a cell is executed from **Cells**&rarr;**Run Cell** or with <kbd>Shift</kbd> &#43; <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

### In Blender

The files within **blend-scripts** can be imported in Blender from **Choose Screen layout**&rarr;**Scripting**&rarr;<kbd>Open</kbd>. To execute them, press <kbd>Run Script</kbd> button and wait for the result.
